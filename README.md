# RESTful Web API with Hapi.js Framework

This project is to build a RESTful API using a Hapi.js framework that will interfaces with the private blockchain By configuring an API for your private blockchain you expose functionality that can be consumed by several types of web clients ranging from desktop, mobile, and IoT devices. The API project will require two endpoints:

* GET block
* POST block

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the [Node.jsÂ® web site](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installing

- Use NPM to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.
```
npm init
```
- Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install crypto-js --save
```
- Install level with --save flag
```
npm install level --save
```
- Install hapi.js with --save flag
```
npm install hapi --save
```

- For testing the endpoints, try one of the tools listed below:

 * [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a powerful tool used to test web services. It was developed for sending HTTP requests in a simple and quick way.
 * [CURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) is a command-line tool used to deliver requests supporting a variety of protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and many more.

## Running the tests

To test code:

1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.

2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
```
node
```
3: Load the index.js file by the `.load` command.
```
> .load index.js
```
4: Open another command prompt or shell terminal after loading index.js.

5: Run the following command in the new command prompt or shell terminal to add a block to the chain.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8000/block -d "{\"body\":\"Testing block with test string data\"}"
```
6: Run the following command in the new terminal to call a block from the chain. (The following example calls the block 1 from the chain.)
```
curl "http://localhost:8000/block/1"
```
